Notes for CustomizationLive Demo URL: Replace https://your-portfolio-url.com with the actual deployment URL (e.g., Vercel or Netlify link).
Form Functionality: The contact form currently lacks a backend. To make it functional, integrate a service like Formspree:html

<form action="https://formspree.io/f/your-form-id" method="POST">

Images: Ensure all referenced images (images/8.avif, images/dube.jpg, etc.) are in the images/ folder or update paths accordingly.
Styling Tweaks: If you want to adjust colors, animations, or section spacing, modify css/everystyle.css (e.g., change --accent to a different color).
Dynamic Toggle Text: To make the "View Certifications" link toggle between "Show" and "Hide", you’d need JavaScript. Let me know if you want a snippet for this!
SEO: The meta tags in index.html are optimized, but you can enhance them further with tools like Google Search Console.
