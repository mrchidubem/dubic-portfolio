### Fixes for GitHub Display Issues
To ensure this README looks great on GitHub, I‚Äôve made the following adjustments based on your portfolio and the web results:

1. **Correct Repository Setup**:[](https://docs.github.com/en/account-and-profile/setting-up-and-managing-your-github-profile/customizing-your-profile/managing-your-profile-readme)
   - Ensure the repository is named exactly `mrchidubem` (matching your GitHub username) and is public.
   - The file must be named `README.md` (case-sensitive) and placed in the root of the repository.
   - If it‚Äôs not showing on your profile, go to the repository on GitHub, click ‚ÄúShare to profile‚Äù (if created before July 2020), or verify the repo settings.

2. **Image Paths**:[](https://medium.com/%40patelnitish/create-theme-your-github-portfolio-57248b0ddb9c)
   - Used absolute URLs for images (e.g., `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mrchidubem/mrchidubem/main/images/dube.jpg`) to ensure they render on GitHub.
   - Upload all images (`dube.jpg`, `8.avif`, etc.) to the `images/` folder in the `mrchidubem` repository. If they‚Äôre not there, GitHub won‚Äôt display them.
   - Alternatively, host images on a CDN or Imgur and use those URLs.

3. **GitHub Flavored Markdown Compatibility**:[](https://docs.github.com/en/account-and-profile/setting-up-and-managing-your-github-profile/customizing-your-profile/managing-your-profile-readme)
   - Avoided HTML/CSS that GitHub doesn‚Äôt support (e.g., inline styles, animations like in `everystyle.css`).
   - Used GFM tables, headings, lists, and emojis for clean rendering.
   - Added badges (e.g., GitHub Stats, Visitor Count) from services like `shields.io` and `github-readme-stats.vercel.app` for visual appeal.[](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-write-a-good-readme-file/)[](https://github.com/abhisheknaiidu/awesome-github-profile-readme)

4. **Dynamic Content with GitHub Actions**:[](https://daily.dev/blog/creating-a-killer-github-profile-readme-part-1)[](https://towardsdatascience.com/create-a-simple-continuous-integration-ci-for-medium-rss-feed-in-github-profile-readme-b5dc6fdf6315/)
   - Included placeholders for blog posts (`<!-- BLOG-POST-LIST:START -->`) to support dynamic updates via GitHub Actions.
   - To auto-update blog posts (e.g., from a Medium RSS feed), create a `.github/workflows/update-blog.yml` file:
     ```yaml
     name: Update Blog Posts
     on:
       schedule:
         - cron: '0 0 * * *' # Runs daily
       workflow_dispatch:
     jobs:
       update-readme:
         runs-on: ubuntu-latest
         steps:
           - uses: actions/checkout@v3
           - uses: gautamkrishnar/blog-post-workflow@master
             with:
               feed_list: "https://medium.com/feed/@your-medium-username"
     ```
     Replace `@your-medium-username` with your Medium profile‚Äôs RSS feed URL.

5. **Badges and Stats**:[](https://medium.com/design-bootcamp/how-to-design-an-attractive-github-profile-readme-3618d6c53783)[](https://www.sitepoint.com/github-profile-readme/)
   - Added GitHub Stats and Top Languages cards using `github-readme-stats.vercel.app` for a professional, data-driven look.
   - Included a visitor counter badge for engagement metrics.
   - These are auto-updating and don‚Äôt require manual maintenance.

6. **Simplified Styling**:[](https://dev.to/denvermullets/how-to-use-your-github-s-profile-readme-as-a-portfolio-page-336e)
   - Focused on minimal, crisp design with emojis and icons instead of heavy CSS styling, as GitHub doesn‚Äôt support custom CSS in READMEs.
   - Used Markdown tables and lists to mimic the portfolio‚Äôs structured layout.

### Steps to Ensure Proper Display
1. **Verify Repository Setup**:
   - Go to `https://github.com/mrchidubem/mrchidubem`.
   - Ensure it‚Äôs public and contains `README.md` in the root.
   - If the repo doesn‚Äôt exist, create it:
     - Click the ‚Äú+‚Äù icon on GitHub, select ‚ÄúNew Repository.‚Äù
     - Name it `mrchidubem`, check ‚ÄúPublic,‚Äù and initialize with a README.
     - Commit the above `README.md` content.

2. **Upload Images**:
   - Add all images (`dube.jpg`, `8.avif`, etc.) to the `images/` folder in the repository.
   - Use `git add images/*`, `git commit -m "Add images"`, and `git push` to upload.
   - Verify image URLs work by previewing them (e.g., `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mrchidubem/mrchidubem/main/images/dube.jpg`).

3. **Test Rendering**:
   - Edit `README.md` in GitHub‚Äôs editor (click the pencil icon) and use the ‚ÄúPreview‚Äù tab to check formatting.
   - Ensure all links, images, and badges display correctly.
   - If emojis or badges don‚Äôt render, double-check the URLs or Markdown syntax.

4. **Enable GitHub Actions for Dynamic Content**:
   - If using the blog post workflow, create the `.github/workflows/update-blog.yml` file as shown above.
   - Commit it to enable automatic updates.

5. **Deploy Portfolio Website**:[](https://medium.com/%40kapil0123/building-your-stunning-github-portfolio-a-step-by-step-guide-a5e8650c5009)
   - To make the portfolio website (e.g., `josephokafor.dev`) live, use GitHub Pages:
     - Rename the repository to `mrchidubem.github.io` or create a new one.
     - Go to Settings > Pages, set the source to the `main` branch, and save.
     - Copy your portfolio files (`index.html`, `css/`, `images/`, etc.) to this repo.
     - Visit `https://mrchidubem.github.io` to confirm it‚Äôs live.
   - Alternatively, deploy to Vercel or Netlify and update the README‚Äôs portfolio link.

### Troubleshooting Tips
- **Images Not Showing**: Check that image URLs are absolute (e.g., `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/...`). If still broken, host images on Imgur or a CDN.
- **README Not on Profile**: Ensure the repo is named `mrchidubem`, is public, and has content in `README.md`. Check GitHub Docs for profile README setup.[](https://docs.github.com/en/account-and-profile/setting-up-and-managing-your-github-profile/customizing-your-profile/managing-your-profile-readme)
- **Formatting Issues**: Use a Markdown editor like [Dillinger](https://dillinger.io/) to preview GFM rendering.[](https://bulldogjob.com/readme/how-to-write-a-good-readme-for-your-github-project)
- **Dynamic Content Not Updating**: Verify the GitHub Actions workflow is active and the RSS feed URL is correct.

### Enhancing the README Further
- **Add More Badges**: Include badges for skills (e.g., Python, Django) from `shields.io` or `simple-icons`.[](https://medium.com/design-bootcamp/how-to-design-an-attractive-github-profile-readme-3618d6c53783)
- **Interactive Widgets**: Add a Spotify ‚ÄúNow Playing‚Äù card or a GitHub Trophy using tools from `abhisheknaiidu/awesome-github-profile-readme`.[](https://github.com/abhisheknaiidu/awesome-github-profile-readme)
- **ASCII Art**: Use [patorjk.com](http://patorjk.com/) to add a text-based logo for flair.[](https://www.reddit.com/r/github/comments/uulygm/what_are_some_really_nice_github_profile_readmes/)
- **Custom Banner**: Design a banner in Canva and upload it to the repo.[](https://medium.com/swlh/explore-new-github-readme-feature-7d5cc21bf02f)
- **Screenshots**: Add screenshots of your portfolio website to showcase its design.[](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-write-a-good-readme-file/)

### Example of Expected GitHub Look
Your GitHub profile (`github.com/mrchidubem`) should show:
- A banner image (your avatar or a custom graphic).
- Clear headings (`#`, `##`) with emojis for visual hierarchy.
- GitHub Stats and Top Languages cards as images.
- A table for the tech stack, mimicking your portfolio‚Äôs layout.
- Clickable links to projects, socials, and the portfolio site.
- A visitor counter at the bottom.

If it still doesn‚Äôt look right, please share:
- The specific display issues (e.g., broken images, misaligned text).
- A link to your GitHub profile or repository so I can inspect it.
- Whether you want specific enhancements (e.g., more badges, a custom banner).

I can also generate a mockup of how the README should look or provide a JavaScript snippet to enhance the portfolio‚Äôs interactivity (e.g., dynamic toggle text for certifications). Let me know how I can make this even more awesome! üöÄ
